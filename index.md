I am a postdoctoral member at the [Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.sns.ias.edu/). My interests are mostly focused on the epoch of cosmic reionization. However, recently I started to work on strong gravitational lensing and magnetars. You can find my outdated CV [here](KaurovCV.pdf). <br><br>
If you are an undergraduate or graduate student, or even a high-school student, and looking for a project, please do not hesitate to contact me.
