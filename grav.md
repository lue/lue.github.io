If you have never heard, here is how gravitational waves of merging two massive (>20 Solar masses) black holes sound like:<br>

And here is audio of merging neutron stars (sound comes in the last second):<br>

I made a small web app to train yourself to 'whistle' a gravitaional wave:

It may ask you to allow the browser to use the microphone. Obsiously you should agree. There is no reason not to trust me... Really*...

Current version of the script only shows only the total mass of the final object. The calculation is performed through the calculation of the [chirp mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_mass) from the frequency and its derivative assuming that the component masses of the initial two-body system are equal.

It is actually quite hard to mimic any of the measured signals (with high masses).
