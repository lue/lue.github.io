If you have never heard before, here is how gravitational waves of merging two massive (>20 Solar masses) black holes sound like:<br>

Here is the audio of merging neutron stars (sound is audible in the last few seconds):<br>

I made a small web app to train yourself to 'whistle' a gravitational wave (if on mobile use landscape mode):

It may ask you to allow the browser to use the microphone. Obviously you should agree. There is no reason not to trust me... Really*...

Current version of the script shows only the total mass of the final object. The calculation is performed through the calculation of the [chirp mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_mass) from the frequency and its derivative assuming that the component masses of the initial two-body system are equal.

It is actually quite hard to mimic any of the measured signals (with high masses).

I am happy to hear any suggestions and to collaborate on equally useful projects.
